# just_audio

A Flutter plugin to play audio from URLs, files, assets and DASH/HLS streams. This plugin can be used with [audio_service](https://pub.dev/packages/audio_service) to play audio in the background and control playback from the lock screen, Android notifications, the iOS Control Center, and headset buttons.

This plugin has been tested on Android and Web, and is being made available for testing on iOS. Please consider reporting any bugs you encounter [here](https://github.com/ryanheise/just_audio/issues) or submitting pull requests [here](https://github.com/ryanheise/just_audio/pulls).

## Example

Initialisation:

```dart
final player = AudioPlayer();
var duration = await player.setUrl('https://foo.com/bar.mp3');
```

Standard controls:

```dart
player.play();
await player.seek(Duration(seconds: 10));
await player.pause();
await player.stop();
```

Clipping audio:

```dart
await player.setClip(start: Duration(seconds: 10), end: Duration(seconds: 20));
await player.play(); // Waits for playback to finish
```

Release resources:

```dart
await player.dispose();
```

Catch player error: 

```dart
player.setUrl("https://s3.amazonaws.com/404-file.mp3").catchError((error) {
  // catch audio error ex: 404 url, wrong url ...
  print(error);
});
```
