## Example

Initialisation:

```dart
final player = AudioPlayer();
var duration = await player.setUrl('https://foo.com/bar.mp3');
```

Standard controls:

```dart
player.play();
await player.seek(Duration(seconds: 10));
await player.pause();
await player.stop();
```

Clipping audio:

```dart
await player.setClip(start: Duration(seconds: 10), end: Duration(seconds: 20));
await player.play(); // Waits for playback to finish
```

Release resources:

```dart
await player.dispose();
```

Catch player error: 

```dart
player.setUrl("https://s3.amazonaws.com/404-file.mp3").catchError((error) {
      // catch audio error ex: 404 url, wrong url ...
      print(error);
    });
```
